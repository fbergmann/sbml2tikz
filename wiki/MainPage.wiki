# summary How to use SBML2TikZ to generate high quality graphics for SBML models.
== Introduction ==

Welcome to the SBML2TikZ wiki page. Here you can find documentation on the project and sample images generated by the application. SBML2TikZ provides automatic generation of PGF/TikZ TeX Macros to illustrate SBML graphs. The rendering is dependent on the SBML Render Extension proposed by Gauges et al. and the rendering library is built on the existing SBML Layout Library.
